Description:

	In this application, I've implemented basic CRUD operations without utilizing a traditional database. Instead, I've opted for dot net core list storage. Users can add, edit, update, and delete values within the application.

	For the UI, I've provided basic field styles and colors, ensuring responsiveness across devices.

	On the backend, I've created APIs for GET, POST, and PUT operations. These APIs can be used seamlessly with Flutter and React Native applications as well.
